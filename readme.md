# JK3Files mirror index script

This script creates a web frontend for a jk3files backup/crawl I coincidentally made shortly before the site's demise.

The backup contains a file with one json entry per line describing a single download; this entry references the file name and any screenshots of it. This is parsed by the script and a directory structure according to the categories created, with one directory per file.
