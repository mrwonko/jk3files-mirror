(http://z9.invisionfree.com/Hapslashs_Void/)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would also like to thank Hapslash for a awesome model to work with, although I must say that Episode 3 Anakin is much easier to edit then Episode 2, though I do relish the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso thank you to Buffy from the Void for awesome screenshots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk now that I've done the thanking let me go on to describe what I've made here. This re-skin is my attempt to make Corran Horn, the other Jedi that came from Rogue Squadron. Recently a modification came out for Battlefront 2, which had a huge number of new choices for the game. One such choice was Corran Horn but to my surprise the Corran Horn had short hair. I liked the idea of him with short hair so I came up with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess if I were to fit this in to the Expanded Universe this is after I, Jedi. Corran is still newly out of the Starfighter Corps (hence the short hair) but has revealed himself as Corran Horn to the Jedi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does it look like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI basically took the Episode 2 Anakin and turned the robes a green-yellow hue. The Tabards are a light green (Default Model) and a Dark Green (DarkGreen Model) The boots are just straight black with an three straps instead of the regular two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditional Information:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've added icons for the skins but just incase they don't work enter these codes on the console:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n/model hm_corranhorn<br>\r\n/model hm_corranhorn/darkgreen<br>\r\n/model hm_corranhorn/hood<br>\r\n/model hm_corranhorn/robe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstallation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply extract the pk3 to the gamedata/base folder of your Jedi Academy directory.

Most are not very creative though there are some better ones for example: Vapthes from Phonock. That skin got me inspired to try to make a reborn skin that (like Vapthes) didn&amp;apos;t stuck to the standard reborn feeling (you know, the crusader thing). This led me to Drake. Using textures from Desann the skin began to have a dragon like feeling. It all looked great in modview but ingame you could clearly see the &amp;apos;real&amp;apos; mouth sticking out. It was frustrating, but one night browsing the web I found a shader that solved the problem! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skinpack has serveral skin colours to choose from. There are 3 diferent torso&amp;apos;s to choose from but only the default torso comes with all the head colours. The other torso&amp;apos;s are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake Dark: a ninja like skin, though it also has a dark-mage/sith-lord feeling to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNecromancer: This skin was originaly made by me using the Jeditrainer model, I wanted to make a Diablo II Necromancer, but I wasn&amp;apos;t satisfied with it.
